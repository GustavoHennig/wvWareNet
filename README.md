# vwWare-toDotNet

## Project Status: Full C# Rewrite

This project is a complete, from-scratch rewrite of the original `wvWare` (Word document parser) in modern C#.  
- **No native code dependencies**
- **No P/Invoke or interop**
- **All logic implemented natively in C#**

See `REWRITE_PLAN.md` for the detailed rewrite roadmap.

## Goals
- 100% managed codebase
- Modern, maintainable, and idiomatic C#
- Faithful to the original `wvWare` functionality
- Focus on text extraction feature only

## Progress
See `PROGRESS.md` for current status and next steps.
