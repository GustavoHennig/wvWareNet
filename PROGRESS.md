# vwWare-toDotNet Progress

## 2025-06-24
- Project direction changed: Full C# rewrite initiated
- README.md updated to reflect new goals
- Detailed rewrite plan created in REWRITE_PLAN.md
- .NET 9 solution and project structure created
- Coding standards established

## Current Status
- Phase 1 (Project Setup) completed
- Phase 2 (Core Data Structures) in progress
- Basic solution structure:
  ```
  vwWare-toDotNet.sln
  └── WvWareNet/
      ├── WvWaveDotNet.csproj
      ├── Class1.cs (placeholder)
      ├── bin/
      └── obj/
  ```

## Next Steps
1. Implement core data structures (Phase 2):
   - File Information Block (FIB)
   - Character Properties (CHP)
   - Paragraph Properties (PAP)
   - Piece table structures
2. Create CFBF reader prototype
3. Set up basic document parsing scaffold
4. Initialize text extraction logic

## Immediate Tasks
- Create FIB structure implementation
- Research .NET 9 features for binary parsing
- Setup logging infrastructure
- Create basic file stream handling
