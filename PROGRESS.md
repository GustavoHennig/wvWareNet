# vwWare-toDotNet Progress

## 2025-06-24

- Project direction changed: Full C# rewrite initiated
- README.md updated to reflect new goals
- Detailed rewrite plan created in REWRITE_PLAN.md
- .NET 9 solution and project structure created
- Coding standards established

## Current Status

- Phase 1 (Project Setup) completed
- Phase 2 (Core Data Structures) partially completed:
  - FIB implemented
  - CFBF parser prototype created
  - Logging infrastructure set up
  - Basic file stream handling implemented
  - Piece Table structures implemented
  - Character Properties (CHP) implemented
  - Paragraph Properties (PAP) implemented
- README.md updated to reflect current project status

## Phase 3: File Parsing Progress (Completed)

- [x] CFBF reader with FAT chain traversal and sector reading
- [x] Directory entry parsing implemented
- [x] Stream reading logic (using FAT chain and sector size)
- [x] Document parsing scaffold
- [x] Text extraction logic (basic)
- [x] Document model structure

## Phase 4: Document Model (Completed)

- [x] Enhanced in-memory document representation to support sections, runs with formatting, headers, footers, and footnotes
- [x] Implemented SectionProperties class to handle section-level properties

## Phase 5: Text Extraction â€” ðŸš§ In Progress

- [x] Implement text decoding logic
- [x] Handle character encoding conversions
- [x] Process piece tables to extract text
- [x] Build plain text output mechanism
- [x] Added FIB version detection and encryption check
- [ ] Parse and apply character formatting (CHPX/PLCFCHPX) to runs
- [ ] Convert CHPX to CharacterProperties for each run
- [ ] Parse and extract headers, footers, and footnotes
- [ ] Output text with formatting and document structure

## Phase 6: API and Integration â€” ðŸš§ In Progress

- [x] Created `WvDocExtractor` public interface
- [x] Implemented `ExtractText()` method
- [x] Added basic error handling
- [x] Built console test application (in `WvWareNetConsole` project)

## Next Steps

1. Phase 5: Text Extraction
   - Parse PLCFCHPX from Table stream and assign CHPX to each piece
   - Convert CHPX to CharacterProperties for each run
   - Parse and extract headers, footers, and footnotes
   - Output text with formatting and document structure

## Immediate Tasks

- Implement PLCFCHPX parsing and CHPX mapping in PieceTable/WordDocumentParser
- Implement CHPX to CharacterProperties conversion
- Implement header/footer/footnote extraction and output

## Legacy Port Tracking

This table tracks original `wvWare` C files, useful for reference in C# port. All logic is to be rewritten idiomatically.

| C Source File  | Status | Notes                       |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| wvWare.c       | [ ]    | Main logic entry point      |
| wvTextEngine.c | [ ]    | Text extraction core        |
| wvparse.c      | [ ]    | Parser logic                |
| fib.c          | [x]    | File Information Block      |
| plcf.c         | [x]    | Piece table logic           |
| text.c         | [ ]    | Text-related parsing        |
| unicode.c      | [ ]    | Unicode helpers             |
| utf.c          | [ ]    | Encoding helpers            |
| wvConfig.c     | [ ]    | Possibly minimal, for setup |
