The parser output for `examples/title.doc` is not as expected.  
**Expected output:**  
```
I am a heading1 title
I am some big heading2  test non-bold
I am normal bolded
I am normal italic
I am big normal
I am normal ariel
```

**Actual output:**  
```
I am a title
I am some big test non-bold
I am normal bolded
I am normal italic
I am normal
I am normal ariel
```

## Problem summary

- The output does not match the expected result.
- The parser should produce output identical to `title.expected.txt`, but instead produces the content of `title.actual.txt`.
- Very important: This is NOT related to headings or style. It is only a coincidence that the missing words are "heading1", "heading2", and "big". The problem is related to the source of these wordsâ€”they are probably not contiguous in the document. This could come from a dictionary or be inserted with a different algorithm. It is imperative that you investigate how other parsers handle this, such as OnlyOffice and wvWare.

## Additional Info

- Read the markdown files in this project if you need more information.
- Please check `/wvWare` folder as reference to understand how the parse works (C version).
- You can also check the folder `/OnlyOffice-MsBinaryFile` for a different parser written in C++.

## Important
- Do not hardcode solutions.
- Do not use reflection.
- This parser must work with any .doc file.
