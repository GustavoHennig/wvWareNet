The parser output for `examples/title.doc` is not as expected.  
**Expected output:**  
```
I am a heading1 title
I am some big heading2  test non-bold
I am normal bolded
I am normal italic
I am big normal
I am normal ariel
```

**Actual output:**  
```
I am a title
I am some big test non-bold
I am normal bolded
I am normal italic
I am normal
I am normal ariel
```

## Problem summary

- The output does not match the expected result.
- The parser should produce output identical to `title.expected.txt`, but instead produces the content of `title.actual.txt`.
- Very important: This is NOT related to headings or style. It is only a coincidence that the missing words are "heading1", "heading2", and "big". The problem is related to the source of these wordsâ€”they are probably not contiguous in the document. This could come from a dictionary or be inserted with a different algorithm. It is imperative that you investigate how other parsers handle this, such as OnlyOffice and wvWare.

## Additional Info

- Read the markdown files in this project if you need more information.
- Please check `/wvWare` folder as reference to understand how the parse works (C version).
- You can also check the folder `/OnlyOffice-MsBinaryFile` for a different parser written in C++.

## Important
- Do not hardcode solutions.
- Do not use reflection.
- This parser must work with any .doc file.

## Execution plan for AI

1.  **Analyze `examples/title.doc`:**
    *   Attempt to understand the internal structure of `title.doc` to identify how the missing words ("heading1", "heading2", "big") are stored. This might involve looking for differences in how contiguous text is stored versus these specific words.
    *   Consider if these words are part of a specific document feature (e.g., fields, revisions, annotations) that is not being correctly parsed.

2.  **Investigate `wvWare` C project:**
    *   Examine the `wvWare` C source code (specifically `decode_complex.c`, `decode_simple.c`, `text.c`, `chp.c`, `pap.c`, `sep.c`, and any files related to fast saves or revisions) to understand how it extracts and reconstructs text from `.doc` files.
    *   Pay close attention to how `wvWare` handles text runs, character properties, paragraph properties, and section properties, as well as any mechanisms for handling non-contiguous text or document revisions.

3.  **Investigate `OnlyOffice-MsBinaryFile` C++ project:**
    *   Review the `OnlyOffice-MsBinaryFile` source code to gain insights into their approach to parsing `.doc` files and text extraction. This can provide an alternative perspective on handling complex document structures.

4.  **Formulate Hypothesis:**
    *   Based on the analysis of `title.doc` and the `wvWare`/`OnlyOffice` codebases, develop a hypothesis explaining why the words are missing in the current `WvWareNet` parser output. This hypothesis should address the underlying cause of the non-contiguous text or special insertion method.

5.  **Propose Solution for `WvWareNet`:**
    *   Outline a concrete solution for the `WvWareNet` project to correctly parse and include the missing words. This solution should align with the C# porting guidelines (no hardcoding, no reflection, general applicability).

6.  **Implement and Verify:**
    *   Implement the proposed solution in `WvWareNet`.
    *   Verify the fix by running the parser on `examples/title.doc` and comparing the output to the expected result.
    *   Ensure the solution does not introduce regressions for other `.doc` files.
